Toolmaking
----------
Julien Goodwin

-  in your tool set have simple examples for future work

   -  real, but simple uses of libraries

-  toolkit for later uses

   -  things you can plumb together are great

-  write using whatever tool makes sense and/or you know

   -  choose one or two as a primary so you get better at it, and you can share
      with others in your shop (i.e. try to standardize)

-  keep shell scripts to a few dozen lines at most
-  for other limits, no inherent limit, but use sensible modularity and testing
-  testing

   -  testing large operation tools can be hard
   -  splitting elements into testable modules, with their own fake
      implementations for larger system tests can work well
   -  try to keep a standard, shared library constants

-  for any tool you will use more than once, also write some documentation

   -  at the minimum this means code comments or a CLI help output

-  do some input validation (doesn't have to be perfect, but some basic checks are good)

   -  catching gross errors and bailing with a usage message is fine

-  distribution

   -  no personal tools for team problems
   -  have a way to distribute so all team members can run and update

-  for many ops teams having a single toolmaking-focused engineer is a great idea

   -  but a separate team of toolmakers is often bad
   -  if scaling to a separate team have that team work on supporting infrastructure
   -  in other words, the people that use the tool should be involved in making the tool

Python: Bringing your code to the next level
--------------------------------------------
Jan Groth

-  use Python 3
-  use a tool to manage environments and use a dedicated environment for each project
-  aim for readability

   -  use coding conventions
   -  use descriptive file names
   -  use descriptive names within code and don't rely on comments
   -  break into methods

-  aim for beautiful code

   -  use the language construct that fits best

      -  e.g. use list comprehension instead of a for loop

   -  comment the why, not the what

-  don't separate behavior and state: use classes as a blueprint for objects
   to capture state as well as behavior (methods)

   -  re-use code elsewhere
   -  use inheritance
   -  write unit tests

-  use an IDE

What the dep is going on with Go dependency management?
-------------------------------------------------------
Adam Harvey

-  several dependency management tools have come out over time
-  Go 1.12 (next stable release) will ship ``go mod`` as the default package manager
-  ``go mod`` requires semantic versioning

Developer Developer Lightning Talks
-----------------------------------
Adam Harvey

-  `Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/>`_ automatically detects many memory
   management and threading bugs, and profiles programs in detail

-  useful for languages without automatic memory management such as C, C++, and Rust

Brenda Wallace

-  When they publish a law, they publish a reference implementation in Python
   (with unit tests)

-  When the law changes, they can run the tests and if it breaks they can fix the law
-  `rules.nz <http://www.rules.nz/>`_

How Much Do You Trust That Package? Understanding The Software Supply Chain
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benno Rice

-  Supply chain issues

   -  package source tampering
   -  malware
   -  availability (bugs in or unavailability of delivery mechanisms)
   -  defects (aka code bugs)
   -  lack of maintenance

-  Mitigation

   -  support the maintainers
   -  have a management process for third-party dependencies
   -  have an upgrade/update process
   -  have a process to review/audit third-party code

Automated firewall testing
--------------------------
Kristof Provost

-  maintainer of ``pf``, a packet filter (aka firewall) in freeBSD
-  why automated testing?

   -  make sure things actually work
   -  convenient test case
   -  prevent regressions
   -  sanity check when making changes

-  tests should be:

   -  easy to write
   -  easy for everyone to run
   -  fast to run
   -  integrate with existing test framework

-  ``vnet`` is a virtual networking stack you can run tests against
-  ``jail`` isolates the environment in a container

Clockwork: Programming with rules
---------------------------------
Mike O'Connor

-  language for programming custom industrial machines

-  issues:

   -  long term custom hardware support is hard
   -  commercial solutions use binary file formats for source configuration

-  requirements:

   -  retain control
   -  reduce risk
   -  be future-proof
   -  reuse don't rewrite
   -  version control all source code

-  Result:

   -  simple programming language
   -  program pieces are called ``machines``
   -  machine can be simulated easily
   -  a machine state resembles a physical machine state
   -  reduces risk by programming in house, simulating as developing, reusing
      what was done before
   -  future-proof by using Linux and open source software
   -  version control everything
   -  effective debugging tools

-  Clockwork

   -  latproc language
   -  objects are ``machines``
   -  describe machines by states
   -  surrounding tools (shell, control daemon, interpreter, sampler, etc.)

Tuesday Jan 22 - Docs Down Under Miniconf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being kind to 3am you
---------------------
Katie McLaughlin

-  the essentials

   -  write stuff down; it doesn't have to be fancy, just get notes in a place you can find them like a wiki
   -  it needs to be editable right away (don't use a repo with PR process, for example)
   -  make it searchable (e.g. don't put it in a paper notebook)
   -  keep it secure (e.g. behind a company firewall) since it likely has content that the public shouldn't see
   -  make it discoverable for other people in your organisation who need to find it
   -  keep your tools readily available; make sure nothing is dangerous, since you are likely to make a mistake

-  integration

   -  think about ways to display information in various places (e.g. Slack reminder)
   -  make integration contextual
   -  perhaps integrate a documentation link with your alert system

-  post mortem

   -  always loop back and update your documentation and tools after an incident
   -  also help junior engineers with a feedback loop
   -  focus especially on recurring issues
   -  automate where it make sense

-  share your learnings with your team
-  make sure you always update your docs and flag changes to stakeholders
-  show empathy for your fellow engineers

Making Yourself Redundant on Day One
------------------------------------
Alexandra Perkins

-  no matter what you do, when you start a new job you are always entering the unkown and don't know what is going on
-  why?

   -  as a new person, you know the right questions to ask when you start
   -  you won't remember the information the first time you hear it
   -  documenting early makes onboarding future employees faster and easier
   -  robust internal docs fosters an inclusive and diverse workspace; it is an easy way to make people comfortable with finding information

-  what?

   -  document anything you find hard about the job or the company
   -  who is going to benefit from what you write? Consider the audience and write appropriately.
   -  how to book leave?
   -  who to ask about which topics?
   -  information on workplace social events

-  how?

   -  wiki or sharepoint if your company has them
   -  files on your personal computer if you don't have a shared place
   -  saved support tickets
   -  notes to yourself on Slack
   -  screenshots of useful Slack conversations
   -  keep it simple; informal content is your friend
   -  it is internal, so don't worry about making it perfect
   -  run through your own content every once in a while just to make sure it is current, and to help refresh your memory

-  future proofing

   -  create or improve the place where internal docs are stored
   -  docs should be searchable and easily editable
   -  transfer all the docs you did on your personal computer into an accessible location
   -  make others aware of the work you have done
   -  foster a culture of strong documentation. Encourage new hires to participate.
   -  "if you email the update, you write the documentation"

-  quality

   -  accessible
   -  editable
   -  searchable
   -  peer reviewed

JIT Learning: It's great until it isn't
---------------------------------------
Tessa Bradbury

-  When should we learn?
-  JIT: Just in time
-  originally a process used in manufacturing to reduce cost and waste
-  JIT compilers are a similar concept
-  common process: write code => hit an issue => define a problem => find a solution => write code
-  but sometimes that doesn't work
-  assumption: you will ask the required questions
-  counter example: you can't ask if you don't know there's a question to ask
-  assumption: you can figure out what you need to learn
-  counter example: it is not always obvious what the problem is so it is difficult to define the problem
-  assumption: you can find what you need to know
-  counter example: it is not always obvious where to look for an answer; this can especially be a problem with proprietary software since you can't go beyond the docs provided (e.g. look in the code)
-  assumption: you know when you've solved the problem
-  counter example: you may not realise your solution hasn't actually solved the problem
-  assumption: the benefit of getting done now outweighs the cost of getting it wrong (aka Agile)
-  counter example: security
-  we need to think critically about what should be trained in advance and what can be learned JIT


Finding your tribe - choosing open source communities
-----------------------------------------------------
Cintia Del Rio

-  Open Source refers to the product, the development process, and the community
-  just because a product is open source does not mean it has an open source community behind it
-  why you want to contribute can help guide where you will contribute
-  three types of code in public repos
-  source available

   -  backed by companies where open source is not their business model, core maintainer and roadmap controlled by that company
   -  you have very limited influence as an external contributor
   -  communication and decisions do not happen in public

-  one person band

   -  single (or very few) core maintainers
   -  common for dev tools and libraries
   -  single point of failure
   -  very few resources
   -  conflicts might not be handled so well
   -  not really a community

-  communities

   -  communication channels (forums, mail list, chat)
   -  code of conduct
   -  multiple core developers
   -  GitHub org or a website

-  Is a project dead?

   -  commits, issues, pull requests, communication channels

-  Culture

   -  bad issues, declined pull requests, bad communication => how do people interact?
   -  add "can you please" and if it makes a comment polite and not ironic than it is probably ok
   -  is the code of conduct enforced? How hard was it for it to be adopted?
   -  is non-coding work valued? Doing reviews, answering questions, writing documentations.
   -  if material is translated, it is often a sign of a good, diverse culture
   -  diverse cultures tend to be better
   -  reacting well to minor changes (commas, grammar) is good
   -  are there docs/resources for getting started as a contributor?
   -  projects in "cool" languages tend to attract more toxic people
   -  beware of jerks in leadership; they will form the tone of the community
   -  is there someone to ask for help
   -  "I usually end up working on things because I need them rather than choosing specific communities, though I have left some."
   -  You are a volunteer; remember you can leave if you want or need to.
   -  "Does it spark joy?"

Through the looking glass - how user testing can give technical writers better perspective
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fraser Mitchell

-  What is the purpose of technical writing?

   -  give customers complex information in a format that can be understood and is engaging

-  technical writeres don't read manuals from cover to cover

   -  most learn software by testing it out for themselves
   -  narrative of help pages are constructed based on this experience, but it is only the writer's experience
   -  they also become more familiar with the product as they go along and forget what it is like for new users

-  think about your customer

   -  users are searching for help, they're frustrated
   -  with each unsuccessful click, they become more agitated

-  user testing lets you see the user experience first hand
-  contextual enquiry is the most common way of performing user testing

   -  user is given tasks to perform
   -  user is asked questions as they perform the tasks
   -  develop a user testing script (unleash your inner talk show host)
   -  collaborate with your support team and focus on customer pain points
   -  keep the script open ended (e.g. what do you expect to happen when you click this button?)
   -  don't use words that are in the UI as that can skew the choices the user makes

-  selecting participants

   -  start internally, maybe with family and friends
   -  external testers usually require an incentive

-  testing environment

   -  monitor actions of the participant
   -  have colleagues assit you
   -  you only need 5 participants (studies show this finds 80% of issues)
   -  keep the testing session short (not longer than 30mins)
   -  don't be tempted to help the participant, even though it is normally what we do in our job

-  analysis

   -  organise and digest the results
   -  apply affinity diagramming methods
   -  create storyboards or experience maps
   -  what action can you take from what you've learned

The Art and Science of Diagramming
----------------------------------
Adam Moszt

-  diagrams are visual communication
-  when you diagram, you need to consider your audience and anticipate their path
-  give them the information they need; don't go off on tangents
-  don't build a duck (aka a diagram is beautiful if it is functional)
-  a diagram that is too big exceeds the cognitive bandwidth of the audience
-  if you exceed the cognitive bandwidth of a person on a diagram they no longer can understand it easily
-  cognitive bandwidth is 7 +- 2 (aka 5 to 9 items)
-  create a consistent visual language for your audience to understand
-  try to prevent lines from crossing
-  keep visual styles simple and clear
-  style distinct elements distinctly or use emphasis
-  Gestalt law of promiximity: if you put things close together, people tend to view them as a group

   -  this can help extend the cognitive bandwidth

-  Gestalt law of similarity: people tend to view things as a group that look similar

   -  for example you can color elements depending on who performs the action

-  ColorBrewer is a resource for picking distinct colors

How to avoid meetings
---------------------
Maia Sauren

-  stereotypes are not untrue, they are incomplete
-  when you make a private joke without context, someone is left out
-  when you include everyone in a private joke, you create a closer culture
-  whose governance model wins? Consider who gets left out depending on what you choose.
-  it is harder to change a relationship over the phone than to maintain one
-  relationships with a code of conduct are less fragile
-  "how do you want to have arguments?"
-  model good behavior
-  set standards early
-  normalise conflict resolution or you are normalising unresolved conflict
-  address issues early and often
-  adulting: it's for people who don't want to cry even more later
-  have "pre-meeting meetings" in order to resolve issues before the actual meeting
-  conflict resolution can work differently in different cultures
-  step away sometimes to let the culture grow organically
-  "culture eats strategy for breakfast" Peter Drucker


Any advice for creating relationships over the phone?

Disaster recovery book
----------------------
Svetlana Marina

-  you can start with a simple guide: map alert types to dashboard logs and documentation
-  consider impact, expectations, SLAs
-  early and regular communication with the customer is crucial to maintaining their trust
-  add to guide: communication details (email or phone numbers, who to contact when)
-  add to guide: runbook with resolution steps
-  perform RCA and raise a bug report if required
-  post mortem: this should have guidelines for how it is conducted
-  post mortem feedback should be used to improve can help keep the documentation current


The Bus Plan - Junior Staff Training
------------------------------------
Andrew Jeffree

-  the concern is that new staff arrive thinking only about automation (e.g. let's do everything with Puppet)
-  but they don't really understand it
-  how do we give people the skills to execute on the documentation
-  you have to understand what is happening behind the scenes when you push a button in automation
-  this is especially important when the function doesn't already exist
-  it helps to spend some time playing with the technology without automation in order to understand it better
-  do things manually first, before automating
-  training

   -  start with a blank server
   -  give vague instructions (e.g. install Wordpress)
   -  document the steps you used
   -  then try extending it (e.g. multiple servers, SSL, backups, etc.)
   -  don't be afraid of touching things manually

When Agile Doesn't Work Anymore: Managing a Large Documentation Project
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lana Brindley

-  docs age and we need to update them

Proof of concept
-  identify what the problem is
-  figure out how long it will take
-  get buy in from all the stakeholders

Plan
-  advertise your plan

Research
-  who is your audience?
-  talk to your audience if you can, run a survey

User/task analysis
-  what tasks do your readers have?
-  produce a matrix to see how often users consult the docs to complete a task
-  this helps us know where to focus our attention

Write
-  keep track of what and who is doing things

Review
-  What was done? What could be done better?
-  focus on the problem not on the people

Don't be afraid to break the Agile model when you need to. But if you are going to:

-  do outreach with stakeholders
-  track your work somehow in the Agile process, but don't go overboard
-  keep your work in people's minds and give kudos
