Human-Driven Development
------------------------
Aurynn Shaw

-  split between dev and ops causes sadness and tears
-  this is caused by split priorities

   -  ops doesn't want to break anything, so they say no to new things
   -  thus dev isn't allowed to use new things, so they are sad

-  devops solves this problem by aligning development with operations through
   work flow and tools
-  devops is a culture of collaboration
-  *but* development culture can get in the way of collaboration due to a
   culture of dominion

   -  many developers gain a sense of control and power through the development
      domain
   -  this leads to a desire to keep the culture exclusive
   -  this elitism leads some developers to look down on ops
   -  even between developers this elitism exists (contempt culture)
   -  asking questions admits to lack of knowledge = loss of status
   -  forms the basis of imposter syndrome

-  these attitudes make people unwilling to ask for help and destroy
   team cohesion
-  in open source communities, this also leads to loss of community members
-  dominion-centric thinking gets in the way of building better communities
   and better technology
