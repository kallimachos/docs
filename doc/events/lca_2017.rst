Human-Driven Development
------------------------
Aurynn Shaw

-  split between dev and ops causes sadness and tears
-  this is caused by split priorities

   -  ops doesn't want to break anything, so they say no to new things
   -  thus dev isn't allowed to use new things, so they are sad

-  devops solves this problem by aligning development with operations through
   work flow and tools
-  devops is a culture of collaboration
-  *but* development culture can get in the way of collaboration due to a
   culture of dominion

   -  many developers gain a sense of control and power through the development
      domain
   -  this leads to a desire to keep the culture exclusive
   -  this elitism leads some developers to look down on ops
   -  even between developers this elitism exists (contempt culture)
   -  asking questions admits to lack of knowledge = loss of status
   -  forms the basis of imposter syndrome

-  these attitudes make people unwilling to ask for help and destroy
   team cohesion
-  in open source communities, this also leads to loss of community members
-  dominion-centric thinking gets in the way of building better communities
   and better technology
-  How do we fix this?

   -  ask questions
   -  listen
   -  inclusive hiring

-  human-driven development

   -  focus on humans
   -  admit we don't know everything; ignorance is not status
   -  speak up
   -  codes of contact
   -  training
   -  don't let bad apples ruin the barrel
   -  this is critical, because we are building the future of our community

Almost Open - Just close the door behind you
--------------------------------------------
Steven Ellis

-  What does open mean to you?
-  open vs free: just because something is libre doesn't mean it is gratis

   -  note that in many cases gratis actually means you are the product
   -  e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.

-  the shift from traditional apps to SaaS actually makes it harder to get
   access to the source and the data
-  if we don't feed the ecosystem that creates libre technology, it will die
-  some high-level security problems (e.g. heartbleed) are results of libre
   software that isn't being maintained adequately
-  how do we encourage organizations to give back?

   -  acknowledge that we use open libraries
   -  engage and educate
   -  encourage contribution

-  there are many ways to contribute back upstream

   -  bugs
   -  testers
   -  documentation
   -  designers
   -  marketing
   -  project management
   -  code
   -  open data
   -  open APIs

-  change our own practices
-  help change the practices of others

Knit one compute one
--------------------
Kris Howard

-  knitting is binary: knit and purl
-  cast on x stitches = for loop
-  repeat to end of row = while loop
-  size adjustment by stitch number = switch statement
-  stitch patterns = subroutines
-  more than one pattern at the same time = coroutines/yield
-  there are many different ways of conveying stitch patterns
-  `KnitML <www.knitml.com>`_

Mice and Maps
-------------
Rhiana Heath

-  Mouse Guard role playing game, kind of like Lord of the Rings with mice
-  Leaflet: an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly apps
-  Ruby on Rails as the backend
-  maps need to be cut into tiles to enable zoom

The Openness of Closed Systems
------------------------------
Richard Jones

-  aka Minecraft and Open Source
-  Minecraft is closed source, but that hasn't stopped the modders
-  pi.minecraft.net runs on the Raspberry Pi

   -  free, but very limited subset of the game
   -  not a great programming experience, but low barrier to entry

-  Minecraft is a Java program first released in April 2009
-  Four main developments in Minecraft modding:

   -  modified Minecraft: edit the binary; owner reacted by obfuscating the
      code
   -  custom servers: allow mods server side so the client code doesn't need to
      be changed
   -  golden age begins: community removes obfuscation from the source code
   -  forge: unified mod loader and mod developer pack

-  bit.do/pycode-minecraft

Hannah gets Going
-----------------
Hannah Thompson

-  new to Go, new to programming, new to Arduino
-  `Gobot <https://gobot.io/>`_ is a Go framework for the internet of things
-  Arduino is fun, but probably not the best way to learn a new programming
   language
-  books are ok but become out of date quickly with a fast moving language like
   Go
-  online tutorials can be more current, but may not be at the correct level
-  specific goals with an ending are useful
-  changing your learning method is ok
-  don't let tutorials make you feel stupid
-  don't copy and paste: write it again
-  use all the resources available to you

Why Twisted is the best and will make your application awesome
--------------------------------------------------------------
Amber Brown

-  an open source, event-driven networking engine written in Python
-  your application is implemented as protocols connected by transports
-  reactor = event loop

Condensed history of lock picking
---------------------------------
Grace Nolan

-  historically locks were a symbol of wealth and power
-  The era of Perfect Security: 1777-1851
-  nothing is truly secure

Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be rock star developers
--------------------------------------------------------------
Rikki Endsley

-  people are still recruiting for rock stars
-  but rock star programmers are an unfortunate myth
-  the rest of the team loses motivation if one person gets all the attention
-  we need Willie Nelson developers:

   -  help others succeed
   -  learn new skills
   -  accessible
   -  use the best tool for the job
   -  lead
   -  collaborate with a diverse mix of people and groups

Choose your own adventure, please!
----------------------------------
Pia Waugh

-  we need to make active choices about our future
-  with great power comes great inequality, and we periodically break down
   the system to redistribute power
-  individuals have more power now than at any point in history
-  technology, especially the internet, has enhanced individual power
-  all our human systems are self-created; we can recreate them as we wish
-  (B) we should embrace a technological existentialism
-  We are only as free as what we do
-  (B) technological existentialism is a humanism


Docs Down Under Miniconf
------------------------
Brian Moss and Lana Brindley

-  The most amazing miniconf ever!

Stephen King's Practical Advice for Tech Writers
------------------------------------------------
Rikki Endsley

-  `opensource.com <https://opensource.com/>`_
-  `opensource.com/stephen-king <https://opensource.com/stephen-king>`_
-  before you start writing you need to ask the what, why, who, and how
-  research
-  create an outline
-  write
-  revise
-  3 main categories of reader:

   -  lay audience
   -  managerial
   -  experts

-  http://netpress.org/care-feeding-press/
-  `opensource.com/write-better-docs
   <https://opensource.com/write-better-docs>`_
-  *On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft* by Stephen King
-  "If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a
   lot and write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware
   of, no shortcut." Stephen King
-  be clear on expectations and read examples
-  `opensource.com/write-event-recap
   <https://opensource.com/write-event-recap>`_
-  consider how your content might be reused
-  write the longest, hardest version of a piece first
-  "An opening line should invite the reader to begin the story. It should say:
   Listen. Come in here. You want to know about this." Stephen King
-  useful to define the audience at the start of an article so the reader
   knows if it applies to them
-  "When you write a story, you're telling yourself the story. When you
   rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story."
   Stephen King
-  "This suggests cutting to speed the pace, and that's what most of us end up
   having to do (kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks
   your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.)" Stephen King
-  given less experienced writers an outline to work with can save time and
   heartache
-  use signposts and subheadings to give people guidance as they work through
   an article
-  "To write is human, to edit is divine." Stephen King
-  "The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can
   only get better." Stephen King

Sorting out the mess: How information architecture can help
-----------------------------------------------------------
Darren Chan

-  information architect can be a good career path for writers who want to
   progress in a technical direction rather than a management direction
-  IA is the structural design of information or objects
-  IA can be applied anywhere that information is being conveyed
-  IA is critical for making information findable and understandable
-  information is subjective, not objective

   -  e.g. is tomato a vegetable or a fruit?

-  Factors that impact IA design:

   -  context
   -  content
   -  users

-  IA design process:

   -  user research
   -  content analysis
   -  designing
   -  testing

Kernel documentation: what we have and where it's going
-------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Corbet

-  the kernel is a huge project that requires a lot of documentation
-  90% or more of kernel code is written by paid developers
-  but nobody is paid to write kernel documentation
-  the kernel has a well-defined maintainer model that is very hierarchical
-  the maintainer model closely matches the kernel file hierarchy
-  but documentation does not fit this model because it crosses various
   trees and often deals with multiple parts of the kernel
-  everybody touches documentation in some way or another
-  although Linux is at the forefront of OSS in some ways, kernel developers
   tend to be very conservative
-  so moving to a new documentation model takes some convincing
-  Docs are made up of 2000+ .txt files, some more useful than others
-  docs are formatted using Docbook, which uses 34 template files to build
   the docs into various outputs
-  Docbook also pulls from kerneldoc comments, of which there are about 55,000
-  so the kernel has lots of documentation but it is difficult to work with,
   as it has no IA design. Things have just been thrown in as they happened.
-  there is also no cross-document linkage. They are truly 2000+ individual
   docs.
-  basically, this is a documentation system written by kernel developers

   -  there is specialized code in the XML, so the source cannot use standard
      Docbook tools
   -  no formatting in kerneldoc comments
   -  ugly output
   -  hard to set up and make work
   -  slow
   -  brittle
   -  no integration with rest of Documentation directory

-  toward better kernel docs

   -  clean up the mess
   -  better formatted output with a logical tool chain
   -  must retain a plain text format

-  Recent work

   -  added Markdown (later AsciiDoc) to processing kerneldoc comments
   -  but this added more tools and dependencies to the docs build, still slow,
      still no linkage between documents, conflicts between tools

-  Ideal

   -  dispense with Docbook entirely
   -  but using what?

-  Sphinx and ReStructured text

   -  designed for documenting code
   -  designed for large documents in multiple files
   -  widely used, well supported
   -  output to HTML, ePub, PDF

-  Jon put together a POC, discussion ensued, POC was expanded, consensus
   was formed
-  kerneldoc comments work as always using ``kernel-doc`` directive, so no
   need to change them
-  but those comments can now contain RST directives
-  cross-references now available
-  function / data structure indexes
-  much nicer output
-  simpler, faster document build
-  uses the RTD theme
-  to add to the docs just drop an RST file in the Documentation directory and
   add it to index.rst
-  Current status:

   -  merged for 4.8
   -  Sphinx documents, kernel documentation HOWTO, GPU documentation, Media
      subsystem

-  For 4.9:

   -  Documentation/driver-api
   -  merge disparate files so HSI is documented in one place
   -  dev-tools book
   -  PDF output (painful, using LaTex)

-  For 4.10:

   -  process book
   -  core-api book
   -  admin-guide book

-  Future work:

   -  convert other DocBook docs and eventually eliminate DocBook entirely
   -  rethink the kernel-doc utility (20 years of Perl cruft)
   -  incorporate more plain-text documents
   -  bring some order to the Documentation directory
   -  more and better documentation

Writing less, saying more: UX lessons from the small screen
-----------------------------------------------------------
Claire Mahoney

-  in UX the small stuff is actually often the big stuff
-  think of the user as someone to help, someone you want to give a good
   product experience
-  don't want them to spend time in docs; they need the answer and they need
   to get back to work
-  mobile user is "on the go" is a misconception
   -  really, mobiles are used everywhere
   -  device + location + what the user wants to do
-  "lite is alright": myth that mobiles are for casual stuff; people will go to
   bigger devices for real work

   -  but this is not necessarily true; we want the same functionality
      regardless of the device
   -  mobile users are very needy humans: they want parity between devices

-  parity is great, but not always realistic. It can lead to excess noise.
-  so simplification of the interface while retaining features is important
-  shake to send feedback is a neat way to hide some of the complexity of the
   full UI
-  context can be better than words

   -  screen design and function can be better than words

-  context can't do everything, sometimes you need words

   -  but it can be very challenging to reduce text down to the appropriate
      size
   -  you need to sweat the details, like push notifications

-  UX testing takes place in Atlab in Sydney
-  Style nests

   -  Atlassian (ADG)
   -  Native (iOS and Android)
   -  Web mirroring style
   -  Discretionary styles

-  patterns are good, repetition is not
-  voice and tone are important and form a pattern as a well. For example,
   Atlassian uses "practical with a wink".
-  it is important to remember that you are not your customer; you are not your
   user
-  ease of use and clear purpose > attractive design and quality of
   microinteractions
-  user -> app -> objective

Effective docs writing: Practical writing style explained with computer science
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joe Robinson

-  inspired by Squirrel Girl, Joe explained sentence construction using
   code logic
-  this is a great approach for understanding language syntax, especially
   for people who may know programming logic better than English grammar
-  unfortunately I couldn't take more detailed notes because I was at the
   back of the room without my laptop


Helping Caterpillars Fly
------------------------
Nicola Nye

-  Cyrus is an open source email providing platform
-  the life cycle of a caterpillar is similar to the life cycle of software
-  FOSSy the Caterpillar
-  you have a good idea and get it upstream, then it starts catching on and
   people start adding to it until it gets so big it forms a cocoon.
-  it will either turn into a butterfly, or it will fail to hatch
-  so how do we turn into a butterfly?
-  reasons for failure and how docs can help:

   -  poor documentation -> better documentation
   -  contributor turnover -> knowledge sharing
   -  creeping feature bloat -> define core goals
   -  poor quality -> document standards
   -  poor usability -> feedback to developers
   -  no users -> marketing docs - explain what and why

-  people

   -  paid technical writer (identify stakeholders, make a business case,
      cost/benefit analysis, company already 'paying' for FOSS)
   -  audiences (existing user, marketing, new user, administrator,
      contributors, 'help me, I saw an error message this one time')
   -  communication (global contributors and users, community, tools like IRC,
      MLs, bug trackers, etc.)

-  processes

   -  curators (developers, users)
   -  regular reviews (out of date is worse than none, last reviewed date,
      SME vs fresh eyes vs users)
   -  cleanup (remove old docs and clean up your search results)

-  tools

   -  selection (consider your users, consider your contributors)
   -  templates (document types, style guides, support tools, feed processes;
      these lower the barrier to entry)

-  danger!

   -  not all documentation is good documentation
   -  danger signs include lots of FAQs, no introduction for new folks,
      docs not with code, lack of clear categorization (IA)

-  Three most important doc things:

   -  paid documentation advocate
   -  make it easy
   -  regular reviews

Designing for Failure
---------------------
Dan Callahan

-  Persona was an open source authentication system that let you log in
   to an email provider, then use those credentials to log in to other sites
-  Persona arose because 5 years ago site-specific passwords were causing
   serious problems with security and there were many password breaches
-  we needed to move away from the traditional password per site approach
-  Persona allowed users to identify using any email address they chose
-  Persona has now been decommissioned
-  free licenses are not enough:

   -  persona had an intractable point of centralization
   -  bits rot more quickly online
   -  complexity limits agency
   -  in other words, a free license doesn't further freedom if people can't
      run the software

-  prolong your project's life:

   -  measure the right thing
   -  explicitly define and communicate your scope
   -  ruthlessly oppose complexity

-  plan for your project's failure:

   -  if you know you're dead, say so
   -  ensure your users can recover, without your involvement
   -  use standard data formats
   -  consider how to minimize the harm caused when your project goes away

-  talk about failures and learn from the experiences of others


Listening to the Needs of Your Global Open Source Community
-----------------------------------------------------------
Elizabeth K. Joseph

-  provides simple way for contributors to contact project owners
-  acknowledge every piece of feedback
-  stay calm
-  communicate changes and ask for feedback
-  check in with your teams
-  document your processes
-  but don't beat people with the documentation, still be polite and
   responsive to questions
-  read between the lines; understand what isn't being said
-  developing principles:

   -  have clear software choices
   -  establish an open source policy
   -  boundaries for support
   -  define what you're willing to compromise on
   -  trust your high level view
   -  consider your users: what makes your life easier as a developer may not
      be the best option for your user

Stranger in a strange land: Breaking language monocultures with open source
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Russell Keith-Magee

-  Python is a very popular language because it is both powerful and accessible
-  Python works for many purposes, but does not work natively on many platforms
-  polylingualism is required to work on multiple platforms
-  for professional devs this isn't necessarily a problem, but for other
   people this is a barrier to multi-platform development
-  and it is not really polylingualism, it is parallelized monolingualism
-  BeeWare: The IDEs of Python
-  what is python?

   -  a language specification
   -  a reference implementation (CPython)
   -  this distinction is useful, because it means Python can be run using
      different implementations

-  monolingualism isn't healthy for platforms

JavaScript is Awful
-------------------
Katie McLaughlin

-  variables are global by default
-  duck typing can be confusing
-  == is not the same as ===
-  JavaScript was developed in 10 days and has no versions
-  it has been owned by a few different companies over time, and its
   evolution reflects this
-  ECMAScript is the name of the actual standard
-  because there are no versions, you can never make an update that breaks the
   API because the internet would break
-  CSS and HTML5 can implement most of what JavaScript can do
-  Or you could use a cross-compiler, such as Skulpt or Batavia (part of
   BeeWare), which cross-compile Python to JavaScript
-  for a list of Python to JavaScript cross-compilers, see
   https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js

Challenges when scaling: Continued adventures in Swift's sharding
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Oliver

-  at Geelong last year Matt claimed he had a solution. It didn't quite pan
   out. So he is back to talk about his new solution.
-  Journey so far:

   -  object hashing: ``shard_no = md5(object) >> shard_power``
   -  distributed prefix trees
   -  pivot points / split tree: this worked fine in small scale testing but
      didn't scale
   -  snipping: but at any point in time primary nodes could be in any other
      state

-  current POC:

   -  read only DB to hold metadata, pivot references, and objects

Non-native English speakers in Open Source communities: A True Story
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Masayuki Igawa, Dong Ma, Samuel de Medeiros Queiroz

Cultural challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Japanese**

-  NOT say "yes/no" clearly
-  tend to be perfect
-  keep intonation
-  size of economy
-  focus on reading and writing
-  pronunciation and grammar are very different

**Chinese**

-  Confucian culture
-  *Doctrine of the Mean*: one guideline is Leniency
-  like to say yes, don't like to say no
-  like to listen, don't like to negotiate
-  pronunciation not well understood
-  grammar is quite different from English grammar; this makes writing and
   speaking difficult

**Brazilian - Portuguese**

-  not as big differences as Asian cultures, but still some differences
-  short/direct responses may sound rude
-  "i" (Portuguese) is pronounced like "e" (English)
-  grammar: adjective position is opposite to English
-  some phonemes do not exist in Portuguese, e.g. "th" vs "f"
-  regular schools in Brazil do a poor job of teaching English

Language challenges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Reading**

-  easiest most of the time
-  one of the most important
-  IRC conversation goes fast
-  long emails are tiring and conclusions can be difficult to follow
-  difficult to read between the lines

**Writing**

-  grammar
-  idiomatic English and/or long sentences is difficult
-  the speed of conversation in IRC is a challenge

**Listening**

-  variety of accents is harder for non-English speakers
-  speed
-  vocabulary, slang, idiomatic phrases and grammar
-  noisy environments make it much harder to hear accurately and it is
   difficult for non-native speakers to fill in the gaps

**Speaking**

-  vocabulary and idiom
-  grammar
-  pronunciation
-  speed and fluency

Overcoming obstacles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  cultural challenges are harder than language challenges
-  language immersion is the best approach to learning
-  forget limitations; do your best and you will eventually improve
-  reading improves vocabulary
-  communicate daily
-  use available tools
-  practice with yourself and others
-  one-to-one conversations are really good practice

How newcomers can help themselves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  be friendly
-  find a mentor
-  share your opinion
-  prepare in advance
-  ask questions
-  brush up on your English skills

Tips for native speakers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  be patient
-  speak slowly
-  use simple words and sentences
-  encourage communication
-  do not make fun
