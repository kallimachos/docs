Human-Driven Development
------------------------
Aurynn Shaw

-  split between dev and ops causes sadness and tears
-  this is caused by split priorities

   -  ops doesn't want to break anything, so they say no to new things
   -  thus dev isn't allowed to use new things, so they are sad

-  devops solves this problem by aligning development with operations through
   work flow and tools
-  devops is a culture of collaboration
-  *but* development culture can get in the way of collaboration due to a
   culture of dominion

   -  many developers gain a sense of control and power through the development
      domain
   -  this leads to a desire to keep the culture exclusive
   -  this elitism leads some developers to look down on ops
   -  even between developers this elitism exists (contempt culture)
   -  asking questions admits to lack of knowledge = loss of status
   -  forms the basis of imposter syndrome

-  these attitudes make people unwilling to ask for help and destroy
   team cohesion
-  in open source communities, this also leads to loss of community members
-  dominion-centric thinking gets in the way of building better communities
   and better technology
-  How do we fix this?

   -  ask questions
   -  listen
   -  inclusive hiring

-  human-driven development

   -  focus on humans
   -  admit we don't know everything; ignorance is not status
   -  speak up
   -  codes of contact
   -  training
   -  don't let bad apples ruin the barrel
   -  this is critical, because we are building the future of our community

Almost Open - Just close the door behind you
--------------------------------------------
Steven Ellis

-  What does open mean to you?
-  open vs free: just because something is libre doesn't mean it is gratis

   -  note that in many cases gratis actually means you are the product
   -  e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.

-  the shift from traditional apps to SaaS actually makes it harder to get
   access to the source and the data
-  if we don't feed the ecosystem that creates libre technology, it will die
-  some high-level security problems (e.g. heartbleed) are results of libre
   software that isn't being maintained adequately
-  how do we encourage organizations to give back?

   -  acknowledge that we use open libraries
   -  engage and educate
   -  encourage contribution

-  there are many ways to contribute back upstream

   -  bugs
   -  testers
   -  documentation
   -  designers
   -  marketing
   -  project management
   -  code
   -  open data
   -  open APIs

-  change our own practices
-  help change the practices of others

Knit one compute one
--------------------
Kris Howard

-  knitting is binary: knit and purl
-  cast on x stitches = for loop
-  repeat to end of row = while loop
-  size adjustment by stitch number = switch statement
-  stitch patterns = subroutines
-  more than one pattern at the same time = coroutines/yield
-  there are many different ways of conveying stitch patterns
-  `KnitML <www.knitml.com>`_

Mice and Maps
-------------
Rhiana Heath

-  Mouse Guard role playing game, kind of like Lord of the Rings with mice
-  Leaflet: an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly apps
-  Ruby on Rails as the backend
-  maps need to be cut into tiles to enable zoom

The Openness of Closed Systems
------------------------------
Richard Jones

-  aka Minecraft and Open Source
-  Minecraft is closed source, but that hasn't stopped the modders
-  pi.minecraft.net runs on the Raspberry Pi

   -  free, but very limited subset of the game
   -  not a great programming experience, but low barrier to entry

-  Minecraft is a Java program first released in April 2009
-  Four main developments in Minecraft modding:

   -  modified Minecraft: edit the binary; owner reacted by obfuscating the
      code
   -  custom servers: allow mods server side so the client code doesn't need to
      be changed
   -  golden age begins: community removes obfuscation from the source code
   -  forge: unified mod loader and mod developer pack

-  bit.do/pycode-minecraft

Hannah gets Going
-----------------
Hannah Thompson

-  new to Go, new to programming, new to Arduino
-  `Gobot <https://gobot.io/>`_ is a Go framework for the internet of things
-  Arduino is fun, but probably not the best way to learn a new programming
   language
-  books are ok but become out of date quickly with a fast moving language like
   Go
-  online tutorials can be more current, but may not be at the correct level
-  specific goals with an ending are useful
-  changing your learning method is ok
-  don't let tutorials make you feel stupid
-  don't copy and paste: write it again
-  use all the resources available to you

Why Twisted is the best and will make your application awesome
--------------------------------------------------------------
Amber Brown

-  an open source, event-driven networking engine written in Python
-  your application is implemented as protocols connected by transports
-  reactor = event loop

Condensed history of lock picking
---------------------------------
Grace Nolan

-  historically locks were a symbol of wealth and power
-  The era of Perfect Security: 1777-1851
