<li><em>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</em> by Stephen King</li>
<li>&quot;If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a
lot and write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware
of, no shortcut.&quot; Stephen King</li>
<li>be clear on expectations and read examples</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://opensource.com/write-event-recap">opensource.com/write-event-recap</a></li>
<li>consider how your content might be reused</li>
<li>write the longest, hardest version of a piece first</li>
<li>&quot;An opening line should invite the reader to begin the story. It should say:
Listen. Come in here. You want to know about this.&quot; Stephen King</li>
<li>useful to define the audience at the start of an article so the reader
knows if it applies to them</li>
<li>&quot;When you write a story, you're telling yourself the story. When you
rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.&quot;
Stephen King</li>
<li>&quot;This suggests cutting to speed the pace, and that's what most of us end up
having to do (kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks
your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.)&quot; Stephen King</li>
<li>given less experienced writers an outline to work with can save time and
heartache</li>
<li>use signposts and subheadings to give people guidance as they work through
an article</li>
<li>&quot;To write is human, to edit is divine.&quot; Stephen King</li>
<li>&quot;The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can
only get better.&quot; Stephen King</li>

<h3>Kernel documentation: what we have and where it's going<a class="headerlink" href="#kernel-documentation-what-we-have-and-where-it-s-going" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Jonathan Corbet</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the kernel is a huge project that requires a lot of documentation</li>
<li>90% or more of kernel code is written by paid developers</li>
<li>but nobody is paid to write kernel documentation</li>
<li>the kernel has a well-defined maintainer model that is very hierarchical</li>
<li>the maintainer model closely matches the kernel file hierarchy</li>
<li>but documentation does not fit this model because it crosses various
trees and often deals with multiple parts of the kernel</li>
<li>everybody touches documentation in some way or another</li>
<li>although Linux is at the forefront of OSS in some ways, kernel developers
tend to be very conservative</li>
<li>so moving to a new documentation model takes some convincing</li>
<li>Docs are made up of 2000+ .txt files, some more useful than others</li>
<li>docs are formatted using Docbook, which uses 34 template files to build
the docs into various outputs</li>
<li>Docbook also pulls from kerneldoc comments, of which there are about 55,000</li>
<li>so the kernel has lots of documentation but it is difficult to work with,
as it has no IA design. Things have just been thrown in as they happened.</li>
<li>there is also no cross-document linkage. They are truly 2000+ individual
docs.</li>
<li>basically, this is a documentation system written by kernel developers<ul>
<li>there is specialized code in the XML, so the source cannot use standard
Docbook tools</li>
<li>no formatting in kerneldoc comments</li>
<li>ugly output</li>
<li>hard to set up and make work</li>
<li>slow</li>
<li>brittle</li>
<li>no integration with rest of Documentation directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>toward better kernel docs<ul>
<li>clean up the mess</li>
<li>better formatted output with a logical tool chain</li>
<li>must retain a plain text format</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recent work<ul>
<li>added Markdown (later AsciiDoc) to processing kerneldoc comments</li>
<li>but this added more tools and dependencies to the docs build, still slow,
still no linkage between documents, conflicts between tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideal<ul>
<li>dispense with Docbook entirely</li>
<li>but using what?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sphinx and ReStructured text<ul>
<li>designed for documenting code</li>
<li>designed for large documents in multiple files</li>
<li>widely used, well supported</li>
<li>output to HTML, ePub, PDF</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jon put together a POC, discussion ensued, POC was expanded, consensus
was formed</li>
<li>kerneldoc comments work as always using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">kernel-doc</span></code> directive, so no
need to change them</li>
<li>but those comments can now contain RST directives</li>
<li>cross-references now available</li>
<li>function / data structure indexes</li>
<li>much nicer output</li>
<li>simpler, faster document build</li>
<li>uses the RTD theme</li>
<li>to add to the docs just drop an RST file in the Documentation directory and
add it to index.rst</li>
<li>Current status:<ul>
<li>merged for 4.8</li>
<li>Sphinx documents, kernel documentation HOWTO, GPU documentation, Media
subsystem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For 4.9:<ul>
<li>Documentation/driver-api</li>
<li>merge disparate files so HSI is documented in one place</li>
<li>dev-tools book</li>
<li>PDF output (painful, using LaTex)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For 4.10:<ul>
<li>process book</li>
<li>core-api book</li>
<li>admin-guide book</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Future work:<ul>
<li>convert other DocBook docs and eventually eliminate DocBook entirely</li>
<li>rethink the kernel-doc utility (20 years of Perl cruft)</li>
<li>incorporate more plain-text documents</li>
<li>bring some order to the Documentation directory</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>in UX the small stuff is actually often the big stuff</li>
<li>think of the user as someone to help, someone you want to give a good
product experience</li>
<li>don't want them to spend time in docs; they need the answer and they need
to get back to work</li>
<li>mobile user is &quot;on the go&quot; is a misconception
-  really, mobiles are used everywhere
-  device + location + what the user wants to do</li>
<li>&quot;lite is alright&quot;: myth that mobiles are for casual stuff; people will go to
bigger devices for real work<ul>
<li>but this is not necessarily true; we want the same functionality
regardless of the device</li>
<li>mobile users are very needy humans: they want parity between devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>parity is great, but not always realistic. It can lead to excess noise.</li>
<li>so simplification of the interface while retaining features is important</li>
<li>shake to send feedback is a neat way to hide some of the complexity of the
full UI</li>
<li>context can be better than words<ul>
<li>screen design and function can be better than words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>context can't do everything, sometimes you need words<ul>
<li>but it can be very challenging to reduce text down to the appropriate
size</li>
<li>you need to sweat the details, like push notifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UX testing takes place in Atlab in Sydney</li>
<li>Style nests<ul>
<li>Atlassian (ADG)</li>
<li>Native (iOS and Android)</li>
<li>Web mirroring style</li>
<li>Discretionary styles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>patterns are good, repetition is not</li>
<li>voice and tone are important and form a pattern as a well. For example,
Atlassian uses &quot;practical with a wink&quot;.</li>
<li>it is important to remember that you are not your customer; you are not your
user</li>
<li>ease of use and clear purpose &gt; attractive design and quality of
microinteractions</li>
<li>user -&gt; app -&gt; objective</li>

<li>it will either turn into a butterfly, or it will fail to hatch</li>
<li>so how do we turn into a butterfly?</li>
<li>reasons for failure and how docs can help:<ul>
<li>poor documentation -&gt; better documentation</li>
<li>contributor turnover -&gt; knowledge sharing</li>
<li>creeping feature bloat -&gt; define core goals</li>
<li>poor quality -&gt; document standards</li>

<li>paid technical writer (identify stakeholders, make a business case,
cost/benefit analysis, company already 'paying' for FOSS)</li>

<li>communication (global contributors and users, community, tools like IRC,
MLs, bug trackers, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<li>selection (consider your users, consider your contributors)</li>
<li>templates (document types, style guides, support tools, feed processes;

</ul>

<li>danger!<ul>
<li>not all documentation is good documentation</li>
<li>danger signs include lots of FAQs, no introduction for new folks,
docs not with code, lack of clear categorization (IA)</li>

<li>Persona was an open source authentication system that let you log in

<p>John Dickinson</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>at-rest encryption feature landed in 2016</li>
<li>Swift is an object storage system that can store unstructured content
at massive scale, with redundancy and high availability</li>
<li>Swift uses a REST API<ul>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://swift.example.com/v1/AUTH_acct/cont/obj</span></code></li>
<li>this provides us with the account, container, and object</li>
<li>client &lt;-&gt; proxy &lt;-&gt; storage node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So where should we encrypt the data? Client-side or server-side?<ul>
<li>answer depends on the threat model</li>
<li>Swift needs to secure data on hard drives from being exposed if the hard
drive leaves the cluster</li>
<li>so Swift needs data at-rest server side encryption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>data, metadata, and tags need to be encrypted</li>
<li>but not everything, such as the size of the object, needs to be encrypted</li>
<li>encryption requires a whole lot of keys and keys encrypting keys</li>
<li>master and derived keys are kept on the proxy server, so if a storage node
leaves the cluster it is physically separate</li>
<li>a random key is used to encrypt each object, then the random key is
encrypted using a derived key. The encrypted random key is sent with the
object to the storage node with the data</li>
<li>currently the master key is stored in a configuration file; remember that
the threat model is hardware leaving the cluster, not people with access to
the server</li>
<li>metadata is generally stored in extended attributes on top of the object
file</li>
<li>performance is good; in fact there is no discernible difference between
plain data and encrypted data. This is aided by recent changes in chip
design that improve encryption speeds.</li>

<li>FLOSS is yesterday's gravy; it is in decline</li>
<li>therefore we should:<ul>
<li>build: small pieces on an expanding base (lithification)</li>
<li>so we can have: free running software (app freedom)</li>
<li>because what we really want is: end user development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;We won the battle for Linux, but we're losing the battle for freedom.&quot; -
Doc Searls</li>
<li>Dependencies should be &gt;5 million lines of code, 20 better. That way there
are only a handful of them. Anything smaller and you should just copy it
into your own code.</li>
<li>Advanced programming environments conflate the runtime with devtime -
Bret Victor</li>
<li>open source at devtime isn't enough; we need to ensure open runtime =
Liberal Software</li>
<li>35% of needs could be addressed by a high-level development tool that offers
basic data collection and manipulation</li>
<li>40% could be satisfied by 5 generic web apps (mail, shopping cart, etc.)
that can be customized</li>
<li>we had to convince the world that code is literary so we could copyright it;
if it was a useful artifact, we would patent it</li>

<li>the word <em>algorithm</em> is a Latin transliteration of an Arab scholar's name
who was an early father of algebra</li>
<li>with scattered points, how do you predict usage? Voronoi diagram.</li>
<li>Fourier Transform: decomposes a function of time (a signal) into the
frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be
expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. Often
used for compression.<ul>
<li>Nearly Optimal Sparse Fourier Transform: O(K log N)</li>
<li>developed in 2012, this can dramatically speed up transforms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Single Value Decomposition: a factorization of a real or complex matrix.
Used for signal processing, pattern recognition, etc.</li>
<li>Genetic algorithms: can be applied to engineering problems, such as
designing a better antenna</li>

<h3>A guide to selecting FOSS licenses for programmers and open culture enthusiasts<a class="headerlink" href="#a-guide-to-selecting-foss-licenses-for-programmers-and-open-culture-enthusiasts" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>James Scheibner</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ultimately, open source licenses allow developers to control what is done
with their code</li>
<li>releasing source code without a license != public domain<ul>
<li>great if you want your software to be used as widely as possible</li>
<li>no control over how software is used</li>
<li>there is a bare copyright applied</li>
<li>may discourage others from using your code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>license your code if you want to control:<ul>
<li>who uses it</li>
<li>how they use it</li>
<li>what software they use it with</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how do open source licenses work at law?<ul>
<li>combination of contract and copyright law</li>
<li>contract law used to give effect to license formation: &quot;by modifying and
distributing the program, you indicate acceptance of this license&quot;.
Notify users of the license!</li>
<li>copyright law gives effect to the conditions that control use of the
software and attaches to the originality of the work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>different types of FOSS license:<ul>
<li>permissive: includes an attribution requirement only (BSD/MIT)</li>
<li>restrictive: includes a relicensing requirement for &quot;derivative works&quot;
(GPL/AGPL/LGPL/CC-BY-SA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when is an open source license breached?<ul>
<li>permissive: breached when there is no attribution; you can only seek
damages if there is a breach</li>
<li>restricted: remedies for both lack of attribution and for failure to
relicense derivative work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;derivative work&quot; is still being defined for software as cases are decided<ul>
<li>is it common or unique?</li>
<li>is it a simple or complex?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in Australia, the term used is &quot;adaptation&quot;, not &quot;derivative work&quot;. It is
unclear whether these are the same thing</li>
<li>open data licensing<ul>
<li>mere compilations of data are not original</li>
<li>note the EU's <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sui</span> <span class="pre">generis</span></code> rights</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>license choice:<ul>
<li>public domain: if you don't care about controlling it</li>
<li>permissive: if you want attribution but don't care who/how it is used</li>
<li>restricted: if you want attribution and some control over the use of your
code</li>
<li>data: you may want to license data separately from code</li>
