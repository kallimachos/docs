<li>counter example: you can’t ask if you don’t know there’s a question to ask</li>
<li>assumption: you can figure out what you need to learn</li>

difficult to define the problem</li>
<li>assumption: you can find what you need to know</li>
<li>counter example: it is not always obvious where to look for an answer; this
can especially be a problem with proprietary software since you can’t go
beyond the docs provided (e.g. look in the code)</li>
<li>assumption: you know when you’ve solved the problem</li>
<li>counter example: you may not realize your solution hasn’t actually solved the problem</li>
<li>assumption: the benefit of getting done now outweighs the cost of getting it wrong (aka Agile)</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>diagrams are visual communication</li>
<li>when you diagram, you need to consider your audience and anticipate their path</li>
<li>give them the information they need; don’t go off on tangents</li>
<li>don’t build a duck (aka a diagram is beautiful if it is functional)</li>
<li>a diagram that is too big exceeds the cognitive bandwidth of the audience</li>
<li>if you exceed the cognitive bandwidth of a person on a diagram they no
longer can understand it easily</li>
<li>cognitive bandwidth is 7 +- 2 (aka 5 to 9 items)</li>
<li>create a consistent visual language for your audience to understand</li>
<li>try to prevent lines from crossing</li>
<li>keep visual styles simple and clear</li>
<li>style distinct elements distinctly or use emphasis</li>
<li>Gestalt law of proximity: if you put things close together, people tend to
view them as a group<ul>
<li>this can help extend the cognitive bandwidth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gestalt law of similarity: people tend to view things as a group that look similar<ul>

gains a benefit from it being available</li>
<li>this is particularly important for groups that are often underrepresented by

<li>the government ran an algorithm assessment report to help build trust by
trying to ensure data was safe and that the algorithms did not skew results

<li>‘no’ decisions tended to bring humans into the process; ‘yes’ decisions
tended to be fully automated</li>
