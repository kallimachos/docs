Introduction

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system
with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus
Torvalds for Linux kernel development; it has since been adopted by many other
projects.

Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history
and full revision tracking capabilities, and is not dependent on network access
or a central server.

Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 2.
