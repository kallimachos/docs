git-guide
=========

**git-guide.md** contains some basic git commands written in GitHub Markdown. The guide describes some sample Bash scripts that may make your life easier, and these are also included in the repository in the **scripts** directory.

For convenience, a Docbook XML version of the guide is included in the **docbook** directory. However, this version may not include the most recent changes to the guide.
